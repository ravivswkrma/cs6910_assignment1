Initially, we utilized the `train.py` script to conduct a hyperparameter sweep, incorporating certain sections of the code that were commented out. Towards the end of `train.py`, code for plotting the confusion matrix is also provided but commented out. The `sweep.yaml` file contains the configuration for initializing the sweep with the necessary hyperparameters. Additionally, the file named `Sample Images.png` showcases one sample image from each of the 10 classes in the fashion-mnist dataset. The best set of hyperparameters discovered for the fashion-mnist dataset are as follows:

- Activation function: Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)
- Batch size: 32
- Learning rate (Î·): 0.001
- L2 regularization (alpha): 0
- Epochs: 10
- Hidden layer size: 128
- Number of layers: 5
- Optimizer: Adam
- Weight initialization: Xavier
- Loss function: Cross Entropy
